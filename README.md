Common Libraries for AVR projects
=================================

These are libraries for AVR peripherals and external devices connected to AVR. They are used by the different AVR projects as needed.

For compiling any AVR project, download this repository to any location and rename the directory to 'common'. The AVR project should be downloaded to the same location as 'common'. For example, if you copied the repositories to *'AVR_Projects'* directory, the directory structure would be like:


	AVR_Projects/
	  |
	  |--common/
	  |
	  |--Project1/
	  |
	  |--Project2/
	  |
